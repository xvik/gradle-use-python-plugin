* Hide password inside --index-url pip parameter in console output (#146)
* Add python.indexUrl configuration option (to override default pip repository)

### 4.0.0 (2024-04-13)
* (breaking) Drop gradle 5 and 6 support
* (breaking) All plugin tasks become abstract, so any custom task types should be abstract too
* (breaking) All tasks use lazy properties instead of convention mapping (affects custom tasks)
* Fix `alwaysInstallModules = true` not triggers pipInstall for non-strict requirements file (#94)
  (required for case when requirements file links other files, which changes are not tracked) 
* Add requirements file references (-r file) support under strict mode (#94) 
* Configuration cache compatibility (#89)
* Changed virtualenv version installed by default (python.virtualenvVersion) from 20.4.2 to 20.25.1
  (supports python 3.7 - 3.12)
* Changed default docker image (python.docker.image) from python:3.10.8-alpine3.15 to python:3.11.8-alpine3.19
* New options (python.):
  - breakSystemPackages: adds --break-system-packages for pip install
    May be required on linux to install virtualenv on apt-managed python (e.g. python3.12)
  - docker.useHostNetwork: use host network for docker 
     Works only on linux. When enabled, all container ports automatically exposed on host 
     and configured port mappings ignored 
  - printStats: show all executed python commands (including plugin internal) at the end of the build (with timings)
  - useVenv: use venv instead of virtualenv (enabled by default)
    Venv is installed by default since python 3.3 which removes requirement to install virtualenv. (#77) 
    Fallback to virtualenv when venv not found. All current environments created with virtualenv
    will still be working correctly.
* Add user home dir ("~/") support for the environment path (python.envPath)  
* To use different python for PythonTask useCustomPython = true must be declared now
  (otherwise, pythonPath select by checkPython task would be used (and task's pythonPath ignored))

### 3.0.0 (2022-10-22)
* (breaking) Drop gradle 5.0-5.2 support (minimum required gradle is 5.3)
* Add docker support (python could be started in docker container without local python)
  - Add dockerChown and dockerExec methods for python tasks for customizations in doFirst or doLast closures 
* Add requirements file support (requirements.txt).
  - By default, requirements support is enabled in strict mode:
    plugin reads file contents and expects only exact version matches (allows extracting module declarations
    so external tools could easily parse and update dependencies).
  - In non-strict mode, requirements file processing delegated to pip (no restrictions on declarations)
  - New configuration section: python.requirements
* Add global python binary validation to reveal PATH problems (might not be the same as user shell PATH)
  - Add validateSystemBinary configuration to be able to disable validation (in case it would not work properly)
* Add cleanPython task for removing project-specific virtualenv
* Add python process output to exception message to be sure it will be visible on error (especially on CI)
* Fix potential memory leak due to gradle Project objects caching (#22)
* Fix concurrent virtualenv installation in multi-module project with parallel execution enabled (#19)
* Fix concurrent pipInstall into the same environment with parallel execution

### 2.3.0 (2021-03-01)
* Support python installation from Windows Store (#14)
* Changed virtualenv version installed by default from 16.7.9 to 20.4.2
  (because only recent versions could work correctly with python installed from Windows Store)
* Add minimal required virtualenv check: by default, it's virtualenv 16 (to not fail previously working environments). 
  But it is recommended to use at least 20.0.11 (compatible with Windows Store python). V20 changes pip installation
  strategy in environment to the same version as bundled with virtualenv instead of always downloading new pip (which increase builds stability).
  Configured with python.minVirtualenvVersion. 
* Fix up-to-date check in pipInstall task for VCS modules (the latest pip changed freeze output syntax)
* Hide passwords in logs for pip extra index repository urls with credentials (extraIndexUrls config) (#12)
* Add general logged command cleaning mechanism to Python object for plugin authors (Pip object uses it for passwords hiding)

### 2.2.0 (2020-04-06)
* Add support for `pip` flags: [--trusted-host](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip/#trusted-host) 
  and [--extra-index-url](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#install-extra-index-url) (#10)
  May be set in `python` extension or directly for `pip` tasks (`extraIndexUrls`, `trustedHosts`). 
  Flags applied only to compatible pip commands.
* Allow dashes in vcs module name (for example, now it is possible to specify `#egg=my-module-11.2`).
  NOTE: This may lead to problems with versions also containing dashes (1.1-alpha.1), but
  it may be easily changed manually (to version without dashes: 1.1.alpha.1)
* Move python configuration options from `PythonTask` to `BasePythonTask`:
  `pythonArgs`, `environment`, `workDir`, `logLevel`. Now pip tasks could use 
  these options to fine tune python execution (under pip call).
  NOTE: extraArgs was not moved because exact tasks (like pipInstall) could perform
  multiple commands calls and applying args to all of them is not correct (most likely, fail the build).
  Instead, tasks must implement their own support for additional args.
* Add free options to `pipInstall`:  
  `pipInstall.options('--upgrade-strategy', 'only-if-needed')`.
  It is not possible to support every possible pip flag with api so this manual customization
  is required to cover wider range of use-cases.
* Fix gradle deprecation warnings on some tasks properties (#9)
* Add environment variables configuration in extension: `python.environment 'SAMPLE', 'value'`
* Fix checkPython execution when running from daemon (gradle work dir may differ from project root:
  confirmed case with gradle 6 on java 11).
* Use relative path to virtualenv when possible instead of always absolute          

### 2.1.0 (2020-03-17)
* Add environment variables support (#8):
    - Python object: `Python.environment` (single and map)
    - Python task: `PythonTask.environment` (single and map)

### 2.0.0 (2020-03-13)
* (breaking) Drop java 7 support
* (breaking) Drop gradle 4 support
* Add `python.usePipCache` option to be able to disable cache for dependencies installation 
    ([--no-cache-dir](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#caching))
  Also, option added to Pip object constructor and BasePipTask (with default from extension)
* Add `Python.getBinaryDir()` returning (in most cases) executed python binary folder
    (based on `sys.executable` with fallback to `sys.prefix/bin`)
* Fix virtualenv installation fail when "global" python is already virtualenv due to --user flag usage 
  (like on travis now)
    - Add `Python.isVirtualenv()` method. Virtualenv is detected by `activate` script in python binary 
      (which may not be always accurate, but should work in the majority of cases)
    - `Pip` internally use `Python.isVirtualenv()` to prevent applying --user flag 
    - Configured (`envPath`) or created virtualenv is validated (shows error on incorrect configuration)
    - Show warnings for cases when virtualenv is created from another virtualenv (because it may have side effects)
* Add python extra args support (in contrast to extra agrs, applied after command, python args applied before):
    - Add `Python.pythonArgs` -  args applied just after python executable
    - Add `PythonTask.pythonArgs`   
* Add `Virtualenv.python` accessor to be able to configure additional arguments
* Add installed virtualenv version configuration: `python.virtualenvVersion`. This way, plugin will 
    always install only known to be working version and avoid side effects of "just released" 
    versions. By default, 16.7.9 would be installed because 20.0.x has some not fixed regressions
* Use gradle tasks configuration avoidance for lazy tasks initialization (no init when tasks not needed)                    

### 1.2.0 (2018-08-30)
* Improve virtualenv usage in multi-module project (#5):
    - Fix virtualenv access from module on windows
    - By default virtualenv is created in the root project and used for all modules
        (breaking) note that before virtualenv was created inside module (on linux)
    - Per module python setup is also possible by overriding envPath

### 1.1.0 (2018-05-29)
* Add vcs modules support in format: "vcs+protocol://repo_url/@vcsVersion#egg=pkg-pkgVersion" (#2)
* Support module features syntax: module\[feature]:version (#3)
* PipModule api changes:
    - Added toPipInstallString(): must be used for installation command instead of toPipString()  

### 1.0.2 (2018-04-18)
* Fix pip 10 compatibility (#1)

### 1.0.1 (2017-12-26)
* Fix python command recognition: avoid wrapping for -c module argument
* Support escaped space and quote during command string parsing
* Support command definition as array/list in PythonTask 

### 1.0.0 (2017-12-20)
* Initial release
